\section{}

The vertices of an regular icosahedron centered at the origin with an edge length of 2 are
\begin{equation*}
  (0,\pm z,\pm x)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  (\pm z,\pm x,0)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  (\pm x,0,\pm z)
\end{equation*}
where $x = 1$, $z = \frac{1+\sqrt(5)}{2}$
For the icosahedron with edge length of 0.8, we can scale $x$ and $z$ by $0.4$.

The second step, translating and rotating, is similar with the previous assignment by modifing PMVMatrix.

  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{h6_1.png}} &
    \subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{h6_2.png}} \\
    \subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{h6_3.png}} &
    \subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{h6_4.png}} \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Another interesting thing is mapping texture to an icosahedron. In our case, we use the following equations:
\begin{equation*}
  u = \frac{atan(z, x)}{2PI}, v = \frac{asin(y)}{pi}+0.5
\end{equation*}

\section{}

To calculate normal directions of faces of icosahedron, we cannot directly use the normal attributes of vertices. We have to do it by:
\begin{center}
  normalize(inverse(transpose)(ModelView)) * normal
\end{center}
where the left term has been provided by the fourth matrix in PMVMatrix.

Then we place the light point at (0,0,10) and the camera at (2,5,-1) which used by specular reflection. According Phong reflection model, we combine ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection together(in spot.frag).

In our zip file, we also provided a screen record to show the result.
